This is going to be an informal documentation of design decisions and their rationales. I have no plans for this document, it's just nice to have a place to put down thoughts about the code.

One assumption that's built into the design is that for a board's array representation, a1 -> 0, a2 -> 1, c3 -> 18, etc. This isn't explicitly written anywhere, because I could'nt think of a good way to do it. I think the only places that depend on that assumption are INIT_BOARD_A (in static/init_board.c) and ifp, the function in Board.c to get an array index from a Position struct. That's not too bad IMO.

As far as other design decisions, I really don't know enough about software architecture to be able to back them up well (but that's the point, right?). I think having Board, Brain, and Coelacanth in the same directory makes sense since they're one piece of functionality per file, but static/ kind of makes me nervous as of now. I don't have a good enough grasp on what's needed by both Board and Brain (all the alliteration, said Alice), though, so I'll keep it as-is and be ready to change if necessary.
